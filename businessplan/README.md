#### Why are we using GitHub for Management related stuff?

GitHub, as I see, is more like a version control GUI and every manager needs to be acquainted with it. Also, the resource guide is an attempt to bridge tech and managerial people!

Long story short, GitHub is awesome! We don't need to get into details but PowerPoint is boring.

#### Let's define what the heck is a Business Plan

Not talking about the obvious "Duh! It's a plan for Business".  I call it a document which the founders have memorized and occassionally edit to make sure the blue font of assumptions is turned black. 

Enough of stupid definitions. Let's call it a document that has essential information to evaluate the risk appetite of the founders and overall risk quotient of the business. 

Reading our definition again and again, till we fall asleep, we understand that it is a heavily data backed document (supported by a beautiful tale of conquering a billion dollar market). 

So, what kind of data are we looking at?

#### What goes in a Business Plan?

Lots of data, research, and falling hair! Jokes apart, business plan should ideally begin with a hypothesis revolving around  a problem statement built step by step using qualitative and quantitative data gathering.
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Company Description
    3. Products and Services
    4. Market analysis
    5. Strategy and Implementation
    6. Organization and Management Team
    7. Financial plan and projections

#### Test Driven Development in Business Plan

TDD is a programming style where, in my simple words, TESTS are written/prepared first and then the programming logic is written around it. In simple terms, if you want to build a calculator, using TDD you would prepare tests on successful cases, failure cases and other cases which a user may bump into. With those cases, you build a leakproof solution. 

We will use a similar methodology to develop a business plan that is tested at each step to ensure leaks are reduced. The steps are as:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is a style, not a rule -----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Get your hypothesis ready**: *I will build next apple* is not an hypothesis. *I will build a solution X for market segment Y who are willing to pay Z for solving the problem P, if conquered would lead to a revenues of £YZ* - forms the basis for a strong hypothesis. Do keep in mind that this is just the starting phase and you need to understand its intimate to you
2. **Identify your customer**: I call this "being able to identify your customer by asking 3 questions and 2 assumptions" i.e. if there were 100 people standing infront of you, just by asking 3 questions you should be able to filter 95% of the crowd and be able to identify potential customers. With the remainder, you *assume* who it is. This is a contradictory statement and I intend to write in detail about this here itself, soon!
3. **Talk to your customers: Part-1**: Here, you just validate the problem P from your hypothesis. Just try to ask seriously open questions. Validation doesn't simply mean you are asking whether your customers are facing the problem, it goes deep and will leave you with so much to think about.
4. **Revisit your hypothesis**: You are sure about the problem in your hypothesis? If yes, all good. Otherwise, time to rewrite the hypothesis with the information you have from Step 3 (you don't need to revisit step 3 again if you are confident enough)
5. **Talk to your customers: Part-2**: Now, we venture into the next step of determining the value of the problem. Think of it like this: even if they are facing a problem, are they willing to pay for my solution? If yes, how much? And a very underlooked question is: what's the alternative they are using?
6. **Let's measure the size of the problem now**: You have talked to 40 customers with an average willing price of £20 per month subscription and are ready to build your service. But, wait isn't that *just* £800 per month? Too small, right? Now is exactly the right time to actually determine whether it's a million dollar problem or a billion dollar problem. It's a very different topic to cover, but the gist is to measure/forecast your market size bottom up. Find market research reports around the target market to see how many people are facing the problem you are trying to solve and what percentage of those are your *customers*.
7. **Let's build a spreadsheet solution**: Okay, TDD is incomplete without testing if your solution *actually* solves the problem or not. You don't need a designer UI or a full fledged developer to build that website to test your product (I am assuming most services including apps can be turned to websites for testing). All you need is a spreadsheet and some no-code tools or Google Forms. This can be tough but think of Facebook: it can be a spreadsheet solution as well. Don't miss out on this step.
8. **Let's see who actually commits**: You have your spreadsheet solution ready and are embarassed to show to your customers? Good. That is such a powerful filter. Now, get to your customers and ask for a price (with R% discount). Mark your conversions. 

Great. by the end of step 8, you have all you need to write a business plan (which is essentially documenting the entire process in sections.) There are tons of business plan templates to follow. But the process of getting the data matters the most!
