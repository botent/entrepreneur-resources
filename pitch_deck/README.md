## Most Magical Instrument for an Entrepreneur: the Pitch Deck

Pitch Decks are such powerful yet simple instruments that I sometimes call it a weapon. However, it's a twin-bladed sword: can cut you if not careful enough!

##### What's the purpose of a Pitch Deck?

1. To show off that you're startup! :wink: 
2. To share your story

###### Now how do we actually share our story?

We use **story arcs** to express our journey and get it in a state where it is easily digestible in short span of time. 

A humble reminder: you are pitching your business, not your product.

Below is how I have learnt to prepare my deck:

Slide #0: **Introduction/Logo Slide** (Basically, use it to brag how artistic your logo is :P ): This is the slide that sets the mood for the crowd's expectations.


Slide #1: **The Changing World** :earth_asia: : This slide is most useful in educating your crowd about how the market segment (i.e. YOUR world) has been changing to make space for your company (use this slide only if its relevant)

Slide #2: **The Problem** :worried: : Okay, this is debatable but I like to show my market size here along with the problem, so that the [hypothesis](/businessplan/README.md) is half complete. Talk about the problem YOUR BUSINESS intends to solve NOT your product. 

Slide #3: **The Solution** :yum: : You got your problem slide well and now are working on the Solution. Remember, you are solving the beforementioned problem on some logical ground (after conducting your research) and this is the slide where you put your KNOWLEDGE.

Slide #4: **Competitive Landscape** :smirk: : You definitely are not the only in the market segment. Face it. So, it's good to show who your competitors are and why you are better or why your customers would choose you over them.

Slide #5: **The Team** :couple: : You talk about yourselves and why you are the best to build this company. Remember, use this slide carefully: you don't want to over express yourself.

Slide #6: **Metrics** :chart: : Use this slide (plus another slide) to split between user growth metrics and revenue metrics. This proves your traction and you definitely should include any single user paid as well. Remember 1 > 0

Slide #7(or 8): **User Feedback** :heart: : What your users have told you about your product. Don't just write all positives, we need to keep it real. And everyone knows that there's no company without dropping users.

Slide #8 (or 9): **Fundraise** :moneybag: : Cut the chase and let investors know how much are you raising and for what? i.e. you must provide a tangible milestone with the current round. Be extremely careful with this.

Slide #9 (or 10): **Product Roadmap** :rocket: : Ideally, I would advise 6 quarters (i.e. 18 months') roadmap on this slide. However, don't talk about what tech stack or features etc you will implement. Talk about the core metrics (from Slide #6 ) and their projections.

Slide #10 (or 11): **Financial Projections** :money_mouth_face: : This slide talks about how much revenue are you going to generate over the next 18 months, how much will be spent on marketing etc. Be clear about what you want to show here.

Slide #11 (or 12): **Summary** :sunglasses: : Only 3 points. Think of it like this: if your audience were to forget everything and remember only 3 points about your business, what will it be? And add them here.

Slide #12 (or 13): **Closing** :+1: : Simple slide with logo and thank you text.

#### Commonly Useful Tips :stars:

1. Use your logo on each slide (preferably on bottom right)
2. Add Slide Numbers for sure (it makes life easier)
3. Instead of Generic Slide Title, use the title to communicate the gist of the slide (for eg: in Slide #6 for my company, I used **Growing at 100% Month-on-Month** as the title and it does the job for you (write only true info). It makes sure everyone pays attention)
